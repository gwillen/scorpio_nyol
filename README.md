This is the code that ran the LEDs on the Next Year on Luna sphere, at 7 & C, at Burning Man 2024. The code ran on three Adafruit Feather RP2040 SCORPIO devices, each connected to up to 8 LED strips. The code to receive pixels from an external source was never used in production; there were issues with the serial line mysteriously disconnecting, and I never figured out why. The "the man" animation was written by Lawrence Kesteloot, despite what the git metadata says. The build and push scripts are dependent on Mysterious Arduino Stuff that came with the Arduino IDE.
